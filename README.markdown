* [Documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/ferrous26/hotcocoa/master/frames) WIP

## Note

This is a fork of HotCocoa that is having documentation and regression
tests added to it. If you find issues with hot cocoa you can open
issues and I will try to fix them.

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress; some of the documentation is
being ported from the MacRuby website where it is still available.

The documentation does not include the mappings right now due to the
way that mappings are implemented; a YARD plug-in is needed for that.

## Description

HotCocoa is a thin, idiomatic Ruby layer that sits above Cocoa and
other frameworks. HotCocoa used to be included in MacRuby but is now
managed as a separate gem.  This will allow HotCocoa to accept
contributions and evolve more quickly. To see more information on
HotCocoa (including tutorial) see
[http://macruby.org](http://macruby.org).

## Install

* sudo macrake install

This fork is only available from source right now.

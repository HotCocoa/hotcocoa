# HotCocoa Examples

This directory contains a few demos of using the HotCocoa library.

To learn more about HotCocoa see:

  http://rdoc.info/github/ferrous26/hotcocoa/master/file/docs/Overview.markdown

When you install HotCocoa you get a hotcocoa command which generates a
project directory from a template.

Usage:

```bash
hotcocoa <directory>
```

This will generate your directory structure. The sample apps in this
directory were generated with this command.  The basic HotCocoa
directory structure is:

./directory/Rakefile              #=> used with macrake to build the app
./directory/config/build.yml      #=> build options
./directory/lib/application.rb    #=> application template
./directory/lib/menu.rb           #=> menus used by the app
./resources/HotCocoa.icns         #=> hotcocoa icon

After generating the structure, cd into that directory and run
`macrake` to build.

## Examples

Examples can all be run by running `macrake` from inside the example
directory.

```bash
cd <example-directory>
macrake
```

## HotCocoa::Graphics Examples

There is also a set of examples showcasing some of the things you can
create using HotCocoa::Graphics. You can run the example app directly
by using `macruby`.
